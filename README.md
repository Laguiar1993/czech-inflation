# Czech inflation

**Private full-project transfer**: all tracked models, research data/results, recorded nowcasts and paths, and the exact R35 dashboard. The original project is in `project/`.

## Open the page

Clone this repository and double-click **open-dashboard.cmd**, or open **project/output/inflation_dashboard_r35/index.html** in Chrome. It works immediately without Bloomberg or Python.

## Run the models on the Bloomberg computer

Start with **[project/portable/START_HERE.md](project/portable/START_HERE.md)**. It contains the setup, verification and production commands.

- **[Manual inputs: precise download and entry instructions](project/portable/MANUAL_INPUTS.md)**
- **[Windows environment and Bloomberg setup](project/portable/ENVIRONMENT.md)**
- **[Transfer verification](TRANSFER_VERIFICATION.json)**

The dashboard is the dated September 22, 2026 snapshot. Fresh model runs create new records; they do not automatically rewrite this historical page. All dashboard builders are included for the next dated publication.

Two oversized historical CSVs and the legacy database are losslessly compressed. Run `python -m portable restore` from `project/` after setup. The private release contains the original Git-history bundle. No source research files were rewritten to relocate the project.
